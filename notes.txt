things to add?: 
- what percentage of total listening is attributed to x artist (pie chart) also genre distribution -- not possible nice
- shuffle playlist thing (mom's idea)

todo: 

improve the prompts to give more information about the user, allowing for better recommendations

edit already existing playlist feature?

option to edit the name of newly generated playlist, or just an ai name to fit it

toggle button to use user info or not when generating playlist

pull saved songs and find bpm to then sort it by bpm

default pfp picture if user doesn't have one

refresh access token after however much time

toggle for if the user wants the playlist to be generated with their data or just generic

improve the AI prompt part, have different text boxes for user, like one for how long they want the playlsit to be, 
one for things that NEED to be in the playlist, etc.
